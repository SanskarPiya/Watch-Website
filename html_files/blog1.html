                    <p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The advancement of modern technology has caused changes in every aspect of our life. With brand
                        new innovations that were believed to be impossible, every industry has seen major evolution in
                        their product standards and as well as the expectations and trends of their consumers. Among the
                        various industries, the watch industry is one of the industries which has been revolutionized by
                        technological advancements. With the development of more tech-savvy with exciting new features
                        to the traditional watches blending with the modern features all to cater the need of modern
                        consumers. <br><br>

                        Smart watches with their modern features have led to a new consumer base of tech enthusiasts who
                        like their watches with more features than just time. And with rapid improvement in smart
                        watches the trend is only growing. Smart watches have evolved from watches with quirky tech
                        features to a useful day-to-day product. With their advancement with health features like
                        heartbeat tracker, fitness tracing, sleep monitoring has made them a lifestyle-oriented product.
                        Their focus on functionality has led them to be a competitor to traditional luxury watches. With
                        their affordable price range, they have garnered broad appeal. <br><br>

                        While smart watches have led many consumers to shift from traditional watches, some previous
                        consumers of traditional have doubled down or younger demographic have discovered the simplicity
                        of a watch which only tells time. With the ever-increasing use of tech, people have rediscovered
                        the joys of simple traditional watches. Consumers who want to take a break from overuse of
                        modern technology are increasing and returning to traditional options. What they want is watch
                        that tells time and nothing else. Simply, no matter how many features or customizable design a
                        smartwatch can have, it is not elegant enough for consumers who prefer craftmanship. While
                        smartwatches might have the features, consumers desire the elegance, simplicity and nostalgia
                        offered by the traditional options. <br><br>

                        E-commerce and digital marketing have changed how companies attract consumers. With the wide
                        range offered by e-commerce, manufacturers have been able to reach the global consumer market
                        with ease. With the new broad reach many new niches watch types also have found their consumers.
                        With the use of AR for virtual try-ons it has made consumer shopping experience easier. And to
                        attract the consumer, digital marketing is the vital tool for manufacturers. With the internet
                        have come new forms of marketing. from showing personalized ads to consumers to sponsoring
                        influence trusted by people, it has made getting consumer easier than ever before. <br><br>

                        With concern for environment, many new watch manufacturers have entered the market providing
                        more eco-friendly options. They cater to those consumers who are themselves aware of the need
                        for eco-friendly options. For sustainability, manufactures now days follow practices such as
                        using recycled material, reducing packaging waste and ethically sourcing their raw materials. <br><br>
